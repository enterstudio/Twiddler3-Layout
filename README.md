# Twiddler3-Layout
Being a newcomer to chording is not easy when it comes to choosing a layout. Twiddler 3 comes with such a simplistic default mapping that we are left with [Tabspace](https://github.com/cswetenham/tabspace2.1) which is an old (and only) reasonable configuration to start from.

Learning a layout will take so much time that I want to make the best possible choices.

This is why I opened this repository so I can gather my findings and draw the attention of readers ready to contribute.

One more thing, to make it even more challenging - and more rewarding if it works: A good addition I can think of to the best available solutions so far would be to come up with a common layout (or close enough) for the [Twiddler 3](http://twiddler.tekgear.com/) and a kind of 
_chord-minded_ on-screen Android keyboard like [MessagEase](http://www.exideas.com/ME/me_faq.html).

...all of it is in the wiki
